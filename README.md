Mapping of all unicode characters to rust types.

This mapping was automatically generated from the latest Unicode
Character Database by the `unicode_gen` crate.

Each unicode Block is represented by a module of the appropriate name.
In this module, one module named constants contains a constant for each
character litteral in the block.
In addition to this, an enum represents the block and each character
is represented by a variant of this enum.
